But as a way to get to and from Sri Lanka, I would be willing to give SriLankan another go and pray for a happier experience in what is otherwise a good seat with great food."

There was nothing premium about this experience, except for the fact that the seat was (almost) lie-flat, a godsend when spending about 20 hours on the plane, including the time we spent on the ground as well as in the air. It must be said that the price was not premium, either, which is a small consolation. \n Have things improved since that fateful review in 2017? I’ll let you be the judge of that."

Furthermore, EVA and China Airlines are members of Star Alliance and SkyTeam respectively, giving them a huge boost in traffic. Add in the coronavirus, which started to negatively affect travel just days after Starlux’s first flight, and the airline clearly has an uphill battle. But I am rooting for it to succeed. \n It’s easy to make big promises and bold claims of luxury, and Starlux certainly went heavy on the branding. But the airline lived up to it and then some. The lie-flat seats on a brand-new plane were as close to perfect as you’re going to find on any narrow-body jet, and the food and service (which are much harder to get right) were better than what I’ve experienced on competing airlines for short inter-Asia flights. Not only that, but Starlux did all of this while competing with China Airlines on price, which is not an easy feat when you don’t have economies of scale working for you. \n Assuming Starlux can navigate the challenges of the current aviation environment, I have no doubt that it will get better with time and I’m eagerly awaiting the day it launches long-haul flights."

Granted, the rare boon of a “poor man’s lie-flat seat” was largely responsible for that, but the A350’s cabin enhancements over previous aircraft surely played a part. With its low fuel consumption, ultra-modern flight deck and technological advances, the Airbus twinjet is popular with pilots too, and in his pre-landing announcement our captain lauded the “wonderful airplane” that had just carried us across the Atlantic. \n Would I be looking forward to doing this again without the benefit of makeshift business class? Not especially. But with the low fares South African is offering on this route, I would choose its A350 in coach again."

            "content": "Emirates first class is an amazing experience, yet I left both satisfied and a tad disappointed. My overall impression might be summed up best by my response to the survey that popped up on the IFE screen on arrival. \n From the first-class lounge in Dubai that takes up an entire terminal floor to an enclosed, gilded suite on board, Emirates first class is as glitzy as it gets. Along with the Etihad Residence and Etihad Apartments, it’s one of just three products that offer a shower in the sky. Emirates’ onboard bar is an experience like no other. \n However, some aspects were disappointing. \n Measuring just 22 inches between armrests, the Emirates A380 first-class seat is barely wider than the economy seats in the same aircraft. Emirates packs four suites and two aisles into the A380 upper deck, compared with Etihad and Singapore’s new suites that only have one aisle with a suite on each side. The lack of space on Emirates is noticeable. \n Also, some soft touches fell flat. The experience of arriving at the airport and taking 25 minutes to get to the lounge didn’t measure up to the level of luxury in the first-class lounge and on board. Further, first-class passengers should be given the option of boarding first or last. I should not have been trying to board at the start of boarding time and end up being the last passenger to arrive on the upper deck. \n And yes, I’m going to bring up the caviar again. Although it’s truly a first-class problem, Emirates should know better than to serve caviar with a metal spoon. It’s concerning to hear from a flight attendant that he’s passed along requests from other first-class passengers but nothing has changed. \n Some travelers are happy to completely disconnect in flight, but there are other passengers who either need to stay connected or want to work on a long flight to or from the Middle East. With the Wi-Fi on this flight unusable for long times, these passengers are going to be very frustrated. Emirates needs to improve the Wi-Fi connection. \n With all that said, Emirates first class is a truly incredible experience and one that I’d recommend to anyone who has the miles or cash to try for themselves."
